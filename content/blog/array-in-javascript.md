### What is an array?

In a simple term, an array is a collection of items that consist of the same datatype. It usually have at least one item in the collection and it's starting index is always 0.

Let's our first array

```js
let food = ['Rice','Bread','Meat']
```

We have created an array and stored it in a variable.

We can retrieve an item from an array by specifying the index.

```js
let first = food[0]
console.log(first)
// Rice
```
