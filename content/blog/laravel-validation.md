### What is REST?

**Representational state transfer** (**REST**) is a [software architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture "Software architecture") [style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_style "Architectural style") that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating [Web services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service "Web service"). Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called _RESTful_ Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of [Web resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_resource "Web resource") by using a uniform and predefined set of [stateless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol "Stateless protocol") operations \[Wiki\][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer "Wiki"))
